```

npm i
npm run serve
```

To regenerate the `_site/api/` folder, go to the root directory of
typedoc-site and clone the typedoc repo (the `typedoc` folder is in
`.gitignore`). Then run:

```bash
cd typedoc
npm i
npm run build
node bin/typedoc --options ../typedoc.json
```

To regenerate the `_site/example/` folder:

```bash
cd typedoc/example
npm i
node ../bin/typedoc --options ../../example.typedoc.json
```

If new options have been added since the last update, run the following to
update the typedoc.json schema:

```bash
node typedoc/scripts/generate_options_schema.js _site/schema.json
```
